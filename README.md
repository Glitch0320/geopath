## Description
As an avid long distance skater, I want an app that can show the path I took on a map and keep track of stats like distance and speed. In order to create this, I am utilizing React and Leaflet to recreate and add to the functionality I have created <a href='https://github.com/Glitch0320/skatepath'>here</a>. When I am satisfied with the core path drawing function and stats display, I will implement a server using Express and Mongoose to store my overall statistics, as well as any saved paths. Saved paths will be a list of coordinates and properties like time, distance, top speed, average speed, max, min, and average altitude. This list is bound to change over the production of this app. These paths can be re-added to the map so that I can zoom out and look around to see at which location my top speed and other stats occured. As of right now, this is the minumum goal for this project. I have many ideas for expansion that I will include here once I have begun working on them. As of now, this project has given me some more experience with Leaflet and given me insight into some of React's functionallity.
## Installation
`If you would like to work on this project with me, send me an email and I will be happy to teach and or learn from you. If you want to take this project in your own direction, you are welcome to clone or fork this repository.`
## Usage
When you visit the current live page, click the start button at the bottom right of the screen and allow location access. If you see a circle, the app is narrowing in on your location. When accurate enough, the circle will change to a marker and the path drawing begins. Moving past ~15 m will add your new location, draw the line, and update your stats. For now, this is it. In the coming weeks, you will be able to save finish your path and view it as well as your overall stats on the map. From there, you can choose to save your path or not.
## License

## Contribution Guidelines
Please reach out to me if you are interested in working together on this or if you have any ideas about what you would like to see on this app, although again anyone is welcome to clone this repo and push up their changes or open issues.
## Testing Instructions
For now, I have been testing by deploying my recent changes and taking a short walk. Indeed I will implement a testing function to speed up the development process and catch errors that might not have been found through my current testing method.
